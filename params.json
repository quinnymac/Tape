  "body": "### Welcome to the Tape homepage.\r\nTape is a open source video player that supports many codecs. Some/most/all of these codecs probably have a different license. I don't have much experience with copyright so I'm putting the creator names along with their links in the about window of the app. I will also have it in the README.\r\n\r\n### What do we support?\r\nHere's a list. Anything that's not underlined/bold we don't have.\r\n* MPEG-3 (mp3)\r\n* MPEG-4 (mp4)\r\n\r\nSuggest a issue if you want a codec added.\r\n\r\n### Current update status:\r\nNot released yet. You can build the source code with *Visual Studio 2015* and later.\r\nNot guaranteed to work either.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n**Founder/Programmer**: @quinnymac\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
